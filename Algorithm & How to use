# PasswordValidation 

Algorithm:
  The program must be able to tell the difference between a strong password and a weak one based on
  Lowercase letters
    The program should also say to the user to have Lowercase letters to improve the overall strength of it
    If user has inputted a lowercase letter then the invalidation should turn to valid 
  Capital letters
    The program should also say to the user to have Capital letters to improve the overall strength of it
    If user has inputted a Upper case letter then the invalidation should turn to valid 
  Numbers
    Adding numbers should be a requirement when the user is creating a password so the program should say this
    If user has inputted a numbers then the invalidation should turn to valid 
  Symbols
    The program should encourage users to add symbols to strengthen the password 
    If user has inputted a symbols then the invalidation should turn to valid 
  Length
    Program should check to see if the password is 9 values or less
    If less the program should tell the user to input more values towards the password
  Remember
    Program is suppose to remember the username by using input types


How to use:
1. User should enter their own username
2. User should then make a password that meets the requirements
3. User should then click the remember me checkbox and then click submit
4. When taken to a new page you will see in the search bar that your username and password is displayed
5. If you hit the back arrow you will notice that the program saves the username
